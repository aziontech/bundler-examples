# Azion Bundler Examples

Repository used for [Azion Bundler](https://github.com/aziontech/bundler) E2E tests. 

In this repository, unlike the Azion Samples, the examples go beyond a simple project setup. They implement specific functions and methods for testing various features in end-to-end (E2E) tests, providing a more comprehensive framework for functional testing.
